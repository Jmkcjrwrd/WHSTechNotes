Autcraft was created to shield autistic children from the bullying and exclusion prevalent in unmoderated Minecraft servers, providing them with a structured, supportive environment. Safe spaces are vital because unmoderated platforms often harbor harassment that targets vulnerable users, causing real-world emotional harm. Developers must take responsibility for safety—using tools like Autcraft’s active moderation and clear rules—because users alone cannot control the systemic design of a platform. Without intentional, inclusive design, online communities become toxic and exclusionary, driving away the very people who need connection most. Other examples of inclusive spaces include Sky: Children of the Light, which uses limited communication mechanics to foster positive, non-verbal interactions

One way technology can help create fairness is by giving a voice to peopel who are often ignored. This matters because justice is only possible when the truth about how people are treated is shared with the world. An exampel of this could be a person using a smartphone to record an unfair event and posting it on social media to seek help. This use of technology helps people be treated more fairly because it holds those in power acountable for their actions. By sharing these stories instantly, technology ensures that injustices cannot be easily hiden or forgotten. This digital transparancy acts as a modern tool for the action Dr. King believed was nessasary for change.
